- `unrar` - For RAR archives  
- `tar` - For TAR-based archives
- `7z` (p7zip-full) - For 7-Zip archives
- `Python 3.6+` - Runtime environment

### Quick Install (Debian/Ubuntu/Kali)
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install unzip unrar tar p7zip-full python3
```

### Install Script
We provide an automated installation script for convenience:
```bash
chmod +x install-archive-tools.sh
./install-archive-tools.sh
```

## üì• Installation

### Method 1: Clone from GitHub

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/lithack0/darchive.git
cd darchive

# Install required tools
chmod +x install-archive-tools.sh
./install-archive-tools.sh

# Run the script
python3 darchive.py <archive_file>
```

### Method 2: Debian Package Installation

```bash
# Download the package and installer
wget https://github.com/lithack0/darchive/raw/main/darchive.deb
wget https://github.com/lithack0/darchive/raw/main/install-archive-tools.sh

# Install required tools
chmod +x install-archive-tools.sh
./install-archive-tools.sh

# Install the package
sudo dpkg -i darchive.deb
# or
sudo apt install ./darchive.deb
```

### Method 3: Direct Download

Download `darchive.py` directly and run it as a standalone script:

```bash
wget https://github.com/lithack0/darchive/raw/main/darchive.py
python3 darchive.py <archive_file>
```

## üöÄ Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Extract archive to current directory
python3 darchive.py -f archive.zip

# Extract to specific directory
python3 darchive.py -f archive.tar.gz -o /path/to/output/

# Using installed package
darchive -f archive.7z -o ./extracted/
```

### Advanced Examples

```bash
# Extract ZIP file to custom directory
python3 darchive.py -f documents.zip -o ~/Documents/extracted/

# Extract TAR.BZ2 archive
python3 darchive.py -f backup.tar.bz2 -o /tmp/restore/

# Extract 7z archive with specific output path
python3 darchive.py -f data.7z -o ./project/files/
```

### Command Line Options

```bash
python3 darchive.py [OPTIONS]

Required Arguments:
  -f, --file FILE       Path to the archive file to extract

Optional Arguments:
  -o, --output DIR      Output directory (default: current directory)
  -h, --help           Show help message and exit
```

## üîç How It Works

1. **Format Detection**: Analyzes file extension and uses `file` command for verification
2. **Tool Selection**: Chooses the appropriate extraction tool based on detected format
3. **Extraction**: Executes the extraction using system commands with proper error handling
4. **Verification**: Confirms successful extraction and reports results

$ python3 darchive.py -f document.pdf
Unsupported or unknown archive format: application/pdf
```

#### Extraction Failure
```bash
$ python3 darchive.py -f corrupted.zip
Running: unzip corrupted.zip -d .
Archive:  corrupted.zip
  End-of-central-directory signature not found.  Either this file is not
  a zipfile, or it constitutes one disk of a multi-part archive.  In the
  latter case the central directory and zipfile comment will be found on
  the last disk(s) of this archive.
unzip:  cannot find zipfile directory in one of corrupted.zip or
        corrupted.zip.zip, and cannot find corrupted.zip.ZIP, period.
Extraction failed: Command '['unzip', 'corrupted.zip', '-d', '.']' returned non-zero exit status 9

```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

# Force format detection
python3 darchive.py --format=zip unknown_file.dat
```

## Author's Note üíù

Greetings, digital archaeologists and compression enthusiasts! üëã

I crafted Darchive during those late-night sessions when I found myself constantly switching between different extraction tools, trying to remember the right flags for `tar`, or dealing with yet another "unsupported format" error. We've all been there - staring at a mysterious `.tar.xz` file wondering which incantation of command-line tools will finally free its contents! üóÉÔ∏è‚ú®

This tool represents my journey from frustration to automation. Every archive format supported, every edge case handled, and every user-friendly message was born from real-world pain points that I (and probably you) have experienced. I wanted to create something that would make the simple act of "just extract this file" actually... simple.

Whether you're a system administrator dealing with backup archives, a developer working with compressed packages, or a digital forensics expert analyzing evidence, I hope Darchive becomes that reliable tool in your arsenal that just works, every time.

The beauty of archives lies not just in their compression, but in their ability to preserve and transport our digital world. Each archive tells a story - of files carefully organized, of data preserved for posterity, of someone's work packaged with care. Darchive is my contribution to helping those stories unfold seamlessly.

Remember: behind every compressed file is someone's effort to organize and preserve digital content. Let's honor that by making extraction as smooth as compression should be! üì¶‚ÜíüìÅ

Keep extracting, keep exploring, and may your archives always decompress without errors!

With algorithmic affection and compression compassion,  
**117h4ck** üîì

*P.S. - If Darchive ever saves you from the "tar: invalid option" rabbit hole at 2 AM, just remember that somewhere, a fellow developer is smiling knowing they made your digital life a tiny bit easier! üåôüíª*

---

**Security Note**: Always verify the source and contents of archives before extraction, especially when dealing with files from untrusted sources. Darchive provides the tools, but digital safety is always your responsibility.
